        <h2>Initial Thoughts and Preparation</h2>
        <p>We're excited to kick off the project! After researching the HPI Baja 5B RC Gas car, we've gathered all the
            necessary tools and components to start the build. The first step will be assembling the frame and
            chassis.
        </p>
        <p>We opted for the HPI Baja 5B because of its reputation for durability, speed, and ease of customizability.
            After comparing it to other models, we felt this was the perfect choice for our build, especially since its
            gas-powered engine offers a unique challenge over electric models.</p>
        <p>We anticipate the engine and steering systems to be the most challenging but rewarding parts of the build.
            The detailed instructions and the modular nature of the Baja make it ideal for both novice and experienced
            RC builders.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to build a Baja that’s not only fast and durable but also highly customizable for future
            upgrades. We’re looking forward to taking it out for a test drive once the assembly is complete.</p>

        <h2>Day 1: Frame Assembly</h2>
        <p>09-29-2024 :: Today we began assembling the front steering. We encountered a few challenges with aligning
            certain
            parts but were able to get everything together. Here are a few pictures from the process:</p>

    <div class="blog-post">
        <p>Initial steps included the bulk head assembly, front upper plate, and the front shock mount assembly. We
            realized halfway through the arms installation that we'd made a mistake in positioning them, pointing
            downwards instead of upwards, which we quickly corrected.</p>

    <!-- DAY 2 POST -->
    <div class="blog-post">
        <h2>Day 2: Front Hub Assembly</h2>
        <p>10-06-2024 :: In this phase of our RC build, we tackled several key components: bearing installation, front
            hub carrier assembly, steering linkage assembly, steering rod installation, and the front bulkhead
            installation. Each step brought us closer to the final product, but not without its own set of challenges.
            Here are a few pictures from the process:</p>

        <p>The bearing installation went smoothly, as expected. With the proper tools on hand, seating the bearings into
            the hub carriers was a straightforward task, ensuring the wheel assemblies will spin freely when we get to
            the test drive stage. Next up was the front hub carrier assembly, and it fit together like a glove, adding
            some real structure to the build.</p>
        <p>Moving on to the steering linkage assembly, things started to get more intricate. Piecing together the
            steering components, we could see the vehicle’s handling dynamics coming into play. However, the real
            challenge came during the steering rod installation. To our surprise, the rod end set wasn’t threaded from
            the factory. This caught us off guard, and we had to carefully hand-thread the ends ourselves, which
            required patience and precision to get it just right.</p>
        <p>Once the steering rods were in place, we moved on to the front bulkhead installation. This part was
            satisfying, as it brought everything together, providing structural integrity to the front of the vehicle
            and giving us a clearer picture of how the steering system will operate.</p>
        <p>Though the steering rod installation was a tricky process, it was rewarding to overcome. The build is
            progressing well, and we’re having a blast putting each piece in place. The few hours spent assembling these
            components flew by, and the end result is a front end that looks and feels solid. We’re excited to see how
            it all comes together as we move forward in the build!</p>
